This folder consists of two folders: Final Codes and Practice.

Final Codes is the folder where final product of each step or each task is located, which means that they are ready to be graded.

Practice is the folder where some of the practices are done to complete each step or each task, which means that they are just scribbles and additional materials which I am not confident to be graded on.

So basically, 
please check "Final Codes" to see final product of each task/step.

Thank you for reading.
